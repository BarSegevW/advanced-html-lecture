    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</h2>
    <p>The classic, delicious chocolate chip cookie recipe that everyone loves!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Make sure the oven is fully heated before you put your cookie dough in. This ensures the cookies bake evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Cream Together Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, add 1 cup of softened butter, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 cup of brown sugar. Using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the butter and sugars together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This process should take about 3-4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Add Eggs One at a Time:</strong> Add 2 large eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix together 3 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Stir the mixture to ensure the baking soda is evenly distributed throughout the flour.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Blend Dry Ingredients Into Wet Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until fully combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips:</strong> Gently fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough. You can also add other mix-ins like nuts or raisins if you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Scoop and Drop Dough onto Baking Sheet:</strong> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent the cookies from sticking. Use a spoon or cookie scoop to form dough balls, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each dough ball to allow the cookies to spread.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Bake the Cookies:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes. The cookies are done when the edges are golden brown, but the centers are still soft. For chewier cookies, remove them from the oven while the centers are slightly undercooked, as they will continue to cook on the baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Cool the Cookies:</strong> After baking, remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 3-5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Enjoy Your Homemade Cookies:</strong> Once cooled, enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or as a sweet treat on their own! These cookies should be soft on the inside with slightly crispy edges.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you prefer crispy cookies, bake them for a few extra minutes.</li>
        <li>For softer cookies, take them out when the center is still slightly soft, as they will continue to cook on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>For a twist, try adding chopped nuts (like walnuts or pecans) or a mix of different types of chocolate chips (milk, dark, or white chocolate).</li>
    </ul>
